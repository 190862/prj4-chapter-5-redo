      <h3>Tips to save the world</h3>
		<p>The most obvious ways to help the environment are to conserve energy and use less water. But if you put on your green thinking cap, you can come up with earth-friendly habits.</p>

		<h2>Tip 1</h2>
      <h3>walking</h3>
		<p>Motoring on two feet is a lot more energy-efficient than cruising on four wheels. Walking obviously isn’t a viable choice if you’re headed to see family across the country, but as long as you stay local, you can sneak more foot action into your daily routine and cut down on carbon emissions in the process.</p>

      <h2>Tip 2</h2>
      <h3>Recycle</h3>
		<p>It may be tempting to toss every juice bottle and peanut butter jar, but you can easily repurpose plastic and glass. Think of them as free containers to plant seeds in, store the rice, nuts, and other bulk goods you stocked up on, or to hoard all the extra pennies you saved by recycling.

       <h2>Tip 3</h2>
      <h3>Dieet</h3>
		<p>Cattle use up the most land and produce more greenhouse gases than other animals raised for food. That’s why the most eco-friendly diet is meat-free, or at least beef-free. Producing 2 pounds (the equivalent of 4 jumbo-sized fast-food burgers) of beef releases 132 pounds of greenhouse gasses. The same amount of peas? Just 2 pounds of greenhouse gasses
